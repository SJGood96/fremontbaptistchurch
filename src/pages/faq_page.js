            <h2>How can I be Saved?</h2>
            <p>God Loves You. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should 
                not parish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16(KJV) <br/> Without Jesus you are condemned!  He that believeth on Him is 
                not condemned: but he that believeth  not  is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the 
                <br/> begotten Son of God; John 3:18 (KJV) Why? Because you have fallen short of what God intended! For ALL have sinned, 
                and come short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 (KJV) <br/>You have earned death, but God wants to give you life! For 
                the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 6:23 (KJV) <br/>
                A life that can only come by grace through faith! For by grace ye are saved through faith; and not of yourselves: 
                it is a gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians  2:8-9 (KJV)<br/> How can you begin the life God 
                wants for you? That if you shalt confess (to covenant) with thy mouth <br/>the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe (entrust your 
                life to) in thine heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shall be saved. Romans 10:9 (KJV) <br/>God's promise to you! 
                For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13 (KJV) <br/>However, God chooses the time for 
                you to call upon the Lord!  For Jesus said: No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: 
                John 6:44a (KJV)<br/> Is God drawing you to Jesus? If in your heart you can feel God drawing you to Jesus, Then the 
                time is right for you to receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. <br/>Are you willing to say YES to God? Then from your
                 heart make  your covenant with God, and entrust your life to the risen Saviour, Jesus Christ. <br/>What do you say? Look 
                 back at these scriptures and then say what ever God has laid on your heart. Remember, this is your time with God. 
                 Just open your heart and talk to Him. </p>
                 <h4>What now that I am saved? </h4>
                 <p>1. Pray for God to guide you to a gospel- preaching church. <br/>
                    2. Share with that church your decision for Jesus and follow your Lord in baptism. <br/>
                    3. Pray and READ GODS WORD daily. 4. Share your faith as God creates opportunities! <br/>
                    5. Seek out the ways God would have you serve Him</p>
